# Major Elements in Rocks

## Reagents

!!! tip "Prepare in Advance"
    Since the reagents need to be ready after the fluxing step, its best to prepare them in advance. Notably a solution of saturated oxalic acid is needed and should be prepared the day before the reagents are mixed.

The "Rock-An solution" is used to dissolve the glass bead created in later steps and this solution will be analysed. The concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids are readily available and the oxalic acid should be mixed up by adding (calc for 100mL) to 100 mL DI water, shake it well and let rest at least overnight or put on a shaker overnight.

The Rock-An solution is made up of 5% nitric acid, 1.33% hydrochloric acid and 1.33% oxalic acid in H<sub>2</sub>O. _See recipe in table._

Reagent           | Concentration      | Volume (for 3L)
----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------
DI water          | NA                 | 2770 mL
Nitric acid       | Concentrated (68%) | 150 mL
Hydrochloric acid | Concentrated (37%) | 40 mL
Oxalic acid       | Saturated          | 40 mL


## I: Preparing the Rock Powder

The first step in analysing the rock sample is to create a fine powder.

### Corse Crushing of the Rock

Using a hammer and a metal plate on a sturdy surface, hammer the rock sample down to roughly 1" pieces. Only use the larger pieces and discard "sandy" remains.

!!! warning
    Make sure to wipe both the hammer and plate thoroughly with isopropanol, ethanol, acetone or 
    similar organic solvents. Ideally, both the hammer and plate are contaminant free.

Feed the pieces into a jawcrusher.

!!! warning
    Make sure to wipe the feeder, jaws and recepticle of the jawcrusher with
    isopropanol, ethanol, acetone or similar organic solvent.

### Drying and Sieving

The next step is to recover fine material of appropriate size. First thoroughly dry the material at 100°C for an hour (or until dry). The coarsest material will be unsuitable for the powdering, the finest material may contain atmospheric contaminants or traces. The sieves should be stacked with a coarse size (e.g. 2.8 mm) and a fine size (e.g. 500 μm). Additional sieves can be added to sieve out different sizes.

!!! important "Cleaning the Sieves"
    Before and after sieving it is critical to thoroughly clean the sieves, washing copiously with water (ideally distilled or de-ionized), followed by washing with an organic solvent and mechanically scrubbing with tissue paper. Follow this by drying the sieves with blasts of compressed air and close inspection for bits stuck in the sieves.

Collect the sieved material and label it in an appropriate container.

### Powdering


## II: Weighing the sample

It is crucial to accurately weigh in a precise amount of sample and a precise amount of fluxing agent (LiBO<sub>2</sub>) in a precise amount of dissolving acid. This gives all the solution a comparable matrix and relative concentrations when running the ICP-OES instrument.

### Mixing of the sample and flux

!!! important "Prepare the graphite crucibles"
    The graphite crucibles are being re-used so it is important to properly clean them before use. This is done with a piece of plastic made to fit into the crucible so that the walls and conic bottom can be gently scraped. This has the double benefit of cleaning out any previous remains and smoothing and filling the surface so the sample wont stick as much to it, preventing loss of sample.

#### Calibration standard
Weigh 500mg off the fluxing agent (Lithium metaborate, LiBO<sub>2</sub>) into a clean graphite crucible. Weigh 250mg of a calibration standard in the same crucible. Those are A-ALK, A-THO and B-THO.  The standards and fluxing agent are homogenized in the crucible by gently tapping the crucible against a surface in a circular motion.

!!! note "Precision"
    The powders should be weighed as precisely as possible. The desired value should be reached +/- 0.1 mg at most. Note should be taken that some of the powders (especially the lithium metaborate) can be antistatic so care needs to be taken not to put any on the scale outside of the crucible or on the rim of the crucible. In those cases the crucibles contents should be discarded, the crucible re-cleaned and the weighing disc wiped.

#### The unknowns

The "unknowns" are run in a similar fashion, 200 mg of the LiBO<sub>2</sub> is weighed in a clean graphite crucible, then 100 mg of the unknown, homogenized in the same fashion as above.

!!! warning "Labelling"
    From the moment the sample is added to the crucible the only way to label it is to put the crucible next to its sample name on a piece of paper. The crucible can't be labelled in any way so keeping a good system to keep track of the sample names is critical.

An international standard such as BIR-1, JB-3 or K1919 should be run as an unknown. This reference material will give an idea of how accurate our measurements are.

### Melting the sample

The sample is now ready to be melted and fused into a glass bead that is easily digestible using our Rock-An solution.

The high-T furnace needs to be carefully ramped up to a 1000°C to protect it from damage.

!!! danger "Hot surfaces"
    This step can be extremely dangerous. Be sure to wear protective equipment such as heat resistant gloves and protective eyewear as well as using the right tools after receiving training in using those tools. Never perform this step without a technician supervising you.
