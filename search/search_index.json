Notably a solution of saturated oxalic acid is needed and should be prepared the day before the reagents are mixed. The \"Rock-An solution\" is used to dissolve the glass bead created in later steps and this solution will be analysed. The concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids are readily available and the oxalic acid should be mixed up by adding (calc for 100mL) to 100 mL DI water, shake it well and let rest at least overnight or put on a shaker overnight. The Rock-An solution is made up of 5% nitric acid, 1.33% hydrochloric acid and 1.33% oxalic acid in H 2 O. See recipe in table. Reagent Concentration Volume DI water NA 2770 mL Nitric acid Concentrated (68%) 150 mL Hydrochloric acid Concentrated (37%) 40 mL Oxalic acid Saturated 40 mL I: Preparing the Rock Powder \u00b6 The first step in analysing the rock sample is to create a fine powder. Coarse crushing of the rock \u00b6 Using a hammer and a metal plate on a sturdy surface, hammer the rock sample down to roughly 1\" pieces. Only use the larger pieces and discard \"sandy\" remains. Cleaning the hammer and plate Make sure to wipe both the hammer and plate thoroughly with isopropanol, ethanol, acetone or similar organic solvents. Ideally, both the hammer and plate are contaminant free. Feed the pieces into a jawcrusher. Cleaning the Jawcrusher Make sure to wipe the feeder, jaws and recepticle of the jawcrusher with isopropanol, ethanol, acetone or similar organic solvent. Drying and sieving \u00b6 The next step is to recover fine material of appropriate size. First thoroughly dry the material at 100\u00b0C for an hour (or until dry). The coarsest material will be unsuitable for the powdering, the finest material may contain atmospheric contaminants or traces. The sieves should be stacked with a coarse size (e.g. 2.8 mm) and a fine size (e.g. 500 \u03bcm). Additional sieves can be added to sieve out different sizes. Cleaning the Sieves Before and after sieving it is critical to thoroughly clean the sieves, washing copiously with water (ideally distilled or de-ionized), followed by washing with an organic solvent and mechanically scrubbing with tissue paper. Follow this by drying the sieves with blasts of compressed air and close inspection for bits stuck in the sieves. Collect the sieved material and label it in an appropriate container. Powdering \u00b6 II: Weighing the sample \u00b6 It is important to accurately weigh a precise amount of sample, a precise amount of fluxing agent (LiBO 2 ) and the precise volume of Rock-An solution. This gives the solutions a comparable matrix and concentrations when running the ICP-OES instrument. Mixing of the sample and flux \u00b6 Prepare the graphite crucibles The graphite crucibles are being re-used so it is important to properly clean them before use. This is done with a piece of plastic made to fit into the crucible so that the walls and conic bottom can be gently scraped. This has the double benefit of cleaning out any previous remains and smoothing and filling the surface so the sample wont stick as much to it, preventing loss of sample. Calibration standard \u00b6 Weigh 500 mg off the fluxing agent (Lithium metaborate, LiBO 2 ) into a clean graphite crucible. Weigh 250 mg of a calibration standard in the same crucible. Those are A-ALK, A-THO and B-THO. The standards and fluxing agent are homogenized in the crucible by gently tapping the crucible against a surface in a circular motion. Precision The powders should be weighed as precisely as possible. The desired value should be reached +/- 0.1 mg at most. Note should be taken that some of the powders (especially the lithium metaborate) can be antistatic so care needs to be taken not to put any on the scale outside of the crucible or on the rim of the crucible. In those cases the crucibles contents should be discarded, the crucible re-cleaned and the weighing disc wiped. The unknowns \u00b6 The \"unknowns\" are run in a similar fashion, 200 mg of the LiBO 2 is weighed in a clean graphite crucible, then 100 mg of the unknown, homogenized in the same fashion as above. Labelling From the moment the sample is added to the crucible the only way to label it is to put the crucible next to its sample name on a piece of paper. The crucible can't be labelled in any way so keeping a good system to keep track of the sample names is critical. An international standard such as BIR-1, JB-3 or K1919 should be run as an unknown. This reference material will give an idea of how accurate our measurements are. Melting the sample \u00b6 The sample is now ready to be melted and fused into a glass bead that is easily digestible using our Rock-An solution. The high-T furnace needs to be carefully ramped up to a 1000\u00b0C to protect it from damage. Hot surfaces This step can be extremely dangerous. Be sure to wear protective equipment such as heat resistant gloves and protective eyewear as well as using the right tools after receiving training in using those tools. Never perform this step without supervision. The graphite crucibles are arranged in a rack of 10. This rack can be slided into the furnace using long tongs. The samples go in at a 1000\u00b0C and are kept there for 30 minutes. The tongs are then used to take the rack out and allow the fused beads to cool down for about 10 minutes. Really mind the labels Again, as the crucibles can't be labelled the exact order of the samples in the rack needs to be noted down. Take care to note which end is the front and which the back (the racks have some distuingishing features). Dissolving the sample \u00b6 Prepare bottles in advance Bottles are reused for this purpose and need to be cleaned. If a large amount of samples need to be processed this can be time-consuming and is better done in advance. Each bottle is rinsed with copious amounts of water, rinsing a couple of times with DI water at the end. The bottles are inspected for cleanliness. Some may need mechanical cleaning of the insides. The bottles are allowed to dry overnight. Note that the amount of bottles needed is number of samples + 3 calibration standards + reference solution + any international standards run as unknowns. Calibration standard \u00b6 A clean 100 mL plastic bottle is filled with 75.00 \u00b1 0.01 mL Rock-An solution. One way of doing it is to fill it up to about 70 mL, and then, using a glass pasteur pipetta add less and less at a time until adding dropwise. The drops tend to be 0.03 mL so use best judgement in when to stop. Note The Rock-An solution is assumed to have \u03c1 = 1.00 g/mL. The volume is thus measured on a scale. The calibration standards (750 mg glass bead) are pried out of the graphite crucible with clean tongs, then dropped in 75 mL of the Rock-An solution. This solution is then put in a turning carousel, and left for at least 3 hours, but it is acceptable to leave the carousel running over-night. Reference solution \u00b6 A reference solution is created to run between smples to account for instrumental drifting. That solution is made up of 30.00 \u00b1 0.01 mL of each of the calibration standards in a clean 100 mL plastic bottle. Great care must be taken to keep the ratios 1:1:1. Is 90 mL reference enough? Assuming about 5 mL to be used per measurement, running the reference every 5 samples, running 1 calibration or international standard every 5 samples, allowing for repeated reference measurements and otherwise waste of about 15%, 90 mL of the reference solution should be enough to measure about 60 samples. At 3.5 minutes per sample this would take about 5 and half hour of running time in addition to the hour and a half needed to startup and shutdown the instrument. 90 mL should therefore be enough for all normal use cases.","title":"Rock Composition"},{"location":"icp-oes/rock-comp/#major-elements-in-rocks","text":"","title":"Major Elements in Rocks"},{"location":"icp-oes/rock-comp/#reagents","text":"Prepare in Advance Since the reagents need to be ready after the fluxing step, its best to prepare them in advance.
